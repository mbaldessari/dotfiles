# StreamController Font Awesome Icons
Unofficial Font Awesome icons for the Linux app [Stream Controller](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController).

These icons are taken from the official Font Awesome icons [repository](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) on GitHub. White and black versions of the icons are available. The Python script named `download.py` clones the FontAwesome's GitHub repository and turns the icons white.
